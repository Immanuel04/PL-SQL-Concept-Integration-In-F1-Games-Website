This Topic for the Project is to create a Formula 1 Database Management System.
To efficiently handle the diverse and ever-growing information about users, their preferences, and their interactions, a robust database management system is essential. This is where PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language) operations and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations play a pivotal role.PL/SQL, an extension of SQL, offers a powerful set of tools to create and manage database objects, implement business logic, and automate complex tasks. 
The Pl/SQL Concepts Used in this Project : 
1] Cursors:
Cursors in PL/SQL allow you to process rows returned by a SQL query one at a time. 
2] Procedures:
Procedures in PL/SQL are reusable blocks of code that can accept input parameters and perform a series of actions.
3] Triggers:
Triggers are PL/SQL programs that are automatically executed in response to specific database events (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
